# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges
1. Real-time Synchronization
   - Risk: Players seeing different game states
   - Mitigation: Robust WebSocket implementation with state verification

2. State Management
   - Risk: Inconsistent game state across players
   - Mitigation: Centralized state management with validation

3. Connection Issues
   - Risk: Players disconnecting mid-game
   - Mitigation: Reconnection handling and state recovery

4. Cross-Platform Consistency
   - Risk: Inconsistent experience across devices
   - Mitigation: Unified design system with device-specific adaptations

5. Touch Interface
   - Risk: Poor touch interaction on mobile devices
   - Mitigation: Touch-first design with fallbacks for desktop

6. Screen Real Estate
   - Risk: Information overload on small screens
   - Mitigation: Progressive disclosure and responsive layouts

## MVP Scope
1. Feature Creep
   - Risk: Adding too many features beyond core gameplay
   - Mitigation: Strict adherence to MVP requirements

2. Performance
   - Risk: Slow response times with multiple players
   - Mitigation: Efficient state updates and minimal data transfer
